> ***Abstract:*** Bo Zhao received his Bachelor's Degree in Information Security from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) in 2020, and he is currently pursuing his Master's Degree in Cyberspace Security from NUAA. His current research interests are mainly focused on [federated learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning) and its robustness.

## Research Interests

- 2017.12-2019.12
  - Blockchain and its application
  - Game theory based smart contract design
  - Computational intensive contract
- 2020.01-
  - Blockchain based trustworthy distributed learning (interim)
  - **Byzantine-robust federated learning (ongoing)**
