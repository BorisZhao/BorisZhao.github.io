> ***Abstract:*** Bo Zhao received his Bachelor's Degree in Information Security from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) in 2020, he is currently pursuing his Master's Degree in Cyberspace Security from NUAA. His current research interests mainly lie in trustworthy [federated learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning), especially its robustness and fairness.

## Research Experiences

- 2017.12-2019.12
  - Blockchain and its application
  - Game theory based smart contract design
  - Computational intensive contract
- 2020.01-
  - Blockchain based trustworthy distributed learning (interim)
  - **Byzantine-robust federated learning (ongoing)**

## News

- [10/2022] I received the National Scholarship from MoE, PRC.
- [10/2022] Seems like my paper 'FedCom' has been rejected again. Further revision is abeyant since the design is obsolete.
- [07/2022] My paper 'FedCom' has been rejected.
- [12/2021] My paper 'FedInv' has been accepted by AAAI 2022!
